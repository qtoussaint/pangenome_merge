# pangenome_merge

🚧🚧🚧 Under construction -- use with caution 🚧🚧🚧

Run `pangenomerge -h` to see arguments and descriptions. 'Run' mode merges two or more Panaroo pan-genome gene graphs (or iteratively updates an existing graph). 'Test' mode creates a merged graph and provides clustering accuracy metrics based on a ground truth graph; this mode is considerably slower than run mode and is not intended for use with large datasets (>3k samples).
